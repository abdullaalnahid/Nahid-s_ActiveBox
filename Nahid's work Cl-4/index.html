						<p>A grape is a fruit, botanically a berry, of the deciduous woody vines of the flowering plant genus Vitis. Grapes can be eaten fresh as table grapes, used for making wine, jam, grape juice, jelly, grape seed extract, vinegar, and grape seed oil, or dried as raisins, currants and sultanas. Grapes are a non-climacteric type of fruit, generally occurring in clusters. The Middle East is generally described as the homeland of grape and the cultivation of this plant began there 6,000â€“8,000 years ago. Yeast, one of the earliest.</p>
